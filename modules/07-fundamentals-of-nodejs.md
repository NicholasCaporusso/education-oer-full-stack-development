# 07 - Fundamentals of NodeJS
NodeJS is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows developers to build scalable, high-performance server-side applications. It has gained tremendous popularity in recent years due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which enables efficient handling of concurrent requests and real-time applications.

NodeJS is built on an event-driven architecture, where I/O operations are performed asynchronously, allowing the server to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking the execution. This non-blocking nature makes NodeJS well-suited for building scalable network applications, such as web servers, APIs, and real-time communication systems.

NPM is the default package manager for NodeJS and plays a crucial role in managing project dependencies. It allows developers to easily install, update, and manage third-party packages and modules required for their NodeJS applications. NPM offers a vast ecosystem of packages that can be seamlessly integrated into NodeJS projects, saving development time and effort.

NodeJS provides various ways to read input from the user, such as command-line arguments and the readline module. Command-line arguments allow users to pass data to the NodeJS application when executing it from the command line. The readline module enables interactive communication with the user, allowing the application to prompt for input and process the user's responses.

NodeJS offers a powerful set of APIs for working with the file system through the fs module. With the fs module, developers can perform file and directory operations, such as reading from and writing to files, creating and deleting directories, and handling file uploads. NodeJS provides both synchronous and asynchronous methods for file system operations, giving developers flexibility based on their application's requirements.

NodeJS excels in building web servers and handling HTTP requests and responses. The http module allows developers to create web servers and handle incoming HTTP requests. NodeJS provides a simple and intuitive way to define routes, handle different HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST), and serve static files. It also supports middleware functions that can modify the request or response objects, enabling developers to add functionality such as authentication, logging, and error handling.

NodeJS provides built-in support for working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and CSV (Comma-Separated Values) data formats. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format commonly used for storing and transmitting structured data. NodeJS offers methods to parse JSON strings into JavaScript objects and stringify JavaScript objects into JSON strings. CSV is a popular format for storing tabular data, and NodeJS has packages like csv-parse and csv-stringify that simplify reading from and writing to CSV files.
