# 02 - HTML and CSS refresher
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the fundamental building blocks of web development. HTML is used to structure the content of web pages, while CSS is responsible for the visual presentation and layout. The course begins with a refresher on HTML and CSS, covering the basic syntax, elements, attributes, and best practices for writing clean and semantic code. It also explores responsive web design techniques using CSS media queries to create adaptable layouts for different screen sizes.

BEM is a popular naming convention and methodology for writing modular and maintainable CSS code. It stands for Block, Element, and Modifier, which are the three key components of the BEM naming system. By following the BEM conventions, developers can create reusable and independent CSS components that are easy to understand and maintain. The course covers the principles of BEM, its benefits, and how to apply it in real-world projects.

Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework that simplifies the process of building responsive and mobile-first websites. It provides a comprehensive set of pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components, as well as a flexible grid system for creating layouts. The course explores the features and components of Bootstrap, including the grid system, typography, forms, buttons, and navigation. It also covers how to customize Bootstrap styles and create responsive designs using the framework's responsive utilities.

Emmet is a productivity tool that helps developers write HTML and CSS code faster and more efficiently. It uses a shorthand syntax to generate HTML and CSS code snippets based on abbreviations. The course introduces the Emmet syntax and demonstrates how to use it to quickly create HTML structures and apply CSS styles. It also covers Emmet's advanced features and plugins for popular text editors and IDEs.

Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters, whitespace, and comments from code files to reduce their size and improve web performance. The course explains the benefits of minification and covers techniques for minifying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It also explores tools and automated processes for minifying code as part of the development workflow.

CSS pre-processors, such as Sass, Less, and Stylus, extend the capabilities of traditional CSS by introducing features like variables, nesting, mixins, functions, and inheritance. These features enable developers to write more modular, reusable, and maintainable CSS code. The course covers the basics of CSS pre-processors, their advantages, and how to set up and use them in web development projects. It also explores best practices for working with CSS pre-processors and leveraging their features effectively.
