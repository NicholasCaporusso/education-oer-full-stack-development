# 01 - Introduction to full-stack development
Full-stack development is an approach to web development that involves working on both the front-end and back-end components of a web application. It encompasses a wide range of skills and technologies, making it a challenging yet rewarding field.

To understand full-stack development, it's essential to have a basic understanding of how the Internet works. The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using various protocols, such as HTTP and TCP/IP. When a user enters a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into their browser, the browser sends a request to the server, which then responds with the requested content.

As the Internet evolved, websites have transformed from simple, static pages to complex, dynamic web applications. Web applications offer a more interactive and personalized user experience, often integrating with databases and other back-end services.

Full-stack developers are responsible for developing and maintaining both the front-end and back-end components of a web application. The front-end, also known as the client-side, is the part of the application that users interact with directly. It typically involves technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The back-end, or server-side, handles the behind-the-scenes functionality, such as data storage, processing, and business logic. Common back-end technologies include programming languages like Python, Ruby, and Java, as well as databases like MySQL and MongoDB.

Being a full-stack developer comes with its own set of challenges. Keeping up with the rapid pace of technological changes, ensuring compatibility across different devices and browsers, balancing the development of front-end and back-end components, and maintaining security and performance are just a few of the obstacles full-stack developers face.

To tackle these challenges effectively, many full-stack developers adopt agile development methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban. Agile development emphasizes iterative and incremental development, close collaboration between team members, and adaptability to change. By embracing agile principles, full-stack developers can deliver high-quality web applications more efficiently.

Version control is another crucial aspect of full-stack development. Git, a widely-used distributed version control system, allows developers to track changes to their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of their software. Understanding basic Git concepts and commands is essential for any full-stack developer.
